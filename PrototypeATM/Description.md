# Prototype of ATM (cash machine)

## Specification: 
A basic ATM class was created for cash withdrawals and a normal ATM inheriting from the basic ATM (with an increased withdrawal limit), as well as an RFID ATM for fast contactless withdrawals. A CDM inheriting from a normal ATM (with a money deposit function) has also been implemented. Additionally, each ATM has service information.

## Technologies: C++
